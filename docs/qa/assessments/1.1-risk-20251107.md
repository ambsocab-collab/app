Date: 2025-11-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 7
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 82/100 (Low-Medium Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

*No critical risks (score 9) identified for this foundational setup story.*

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. OPS-001: Environment Configuration Mismatch

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Environment configs often have subtle differences across developer machines
**Impact**: High - Can block development setup and cause inconsistent behavior

**Mitigation**:
- Use environment validation with zod as specified in the story
- Include `.env.example` files with clear documentation
- Add environment validation script to development setup
- Document required Node.js, pnpm, and system dependency versions

**Testing Focus**: Validate environment setup across different platforms (Windows/Mac/Linux)

### 2. TECH-001: Monorepo Workspace Configuration Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - pnpm workspace configuration can be tricky for teams unfamiliar with monorepos
**Impact**: High - Improper configuration can break dependency management and build processes

**Mitigation**:
- Thoroughly document workspace configuration decisions
- Include validation scripts to verify workspace setup
- Add package.json schema validation
- Create troubleshooting guide for common workspace issues

**Testing Focus**: Test package installation, builds, and cross-package dependencies

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

1. **Environment Setup Validation**
   - Test scenarios: Fresh developer setup on different platforms
   - Test types: Integration/E2E
   - Test data: Various environment configurations

2. **Monorepo Configuration Validation**
   - Test scenarios: Package installation, cross-package dependencies
   - Test types: Integration
   - Test data: Different workspace configurations

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

1. **Documentation Completeness**
   - Test scenarios: New developer following README instructions
   - Test types: E2E
   - Test data: Developer with varying experience levels

2. **Build Process Validation**
   - Test scenarios: Parallel builds, script execution
   - Test types: Integration
   - Test data: Different package combinations

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

1. **Security Configuration**
   - Test scenarios: Git hooks, environment variable handling
   - Test types: Unit/Integration
   - Test data: Various security configurations

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (OPS-001, TECH-001) must be mitigated

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks (OPS-002, BUS-001) with documentation and monitoring

### Accepted Risks

- Low risks (TECH-002, DATA-001, SEC-001) with standard practices

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-implementation monitoring for:

- Developer setup success rates
- Build failure patterns
- Environment-related support tickets
- Package installation issues

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New team members join and report setup issues
- Build system changes occur
- New tools or dependencies are added
- Security requirements evolve

## Mitigation Strategies Summary

### Technical Controls
- Environment validation scripts
- Workspace configuration validation
- Automated testing of setup processes

### Process Controls
- Detailed documentation with troubleshooting
- Team onboarding checklist
- Regular reviews of setup issues

### Monitoring Controls
- Track developer setup time
