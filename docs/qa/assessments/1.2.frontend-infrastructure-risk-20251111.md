# Risk Assessment Matrix

## Story: 1.2 - Frontend Infrastructure

### Risk Summary

**Overall Risk Level: LOW**

### Individual Risk Assessments

#### Risk 1: Tooling Compatibility Issues
- **Probability**: Low (1/10)
- **Impact**: Medium (6/10)
- **Risk Score**: 6
- **Mitigation**: Precise version specifications in requirements, testing confirmed compatibility
- **Status**: MITIGATED

#### Risk 2: Performance Budget Compliance
- **Probability**: Low (2/10)
- **Impact**: Medium (5/10)
- **Risk Score**: 10
- **Mitigation**: Performance monitoring and thresholds implemented
- **Status**: MONITORED

#### Risk 3: PWA Implementation Complexity
- **Probability**: Low (1/10)
- **Impact**: Medium (4/10)
- **Risk Score**: 4
- **Mitigation**: Used established Vite PWA plugin with proven configuration
- **Status**: RESOLVED

#### Risk 4: Industrial Design System Adoption
- **Probability**: Low (1/10)
- **Impact**: Low (3/10)
- **Risk Score**: 3
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive design tokens and component library established
- **Status**: RESOLVED

### Risk Thresholds Applied

- **Critical Risk** (≥9): None identified
- **Medium Risk** (≥6): Performance monitoring (mitigated)
- **Low Risk** (<6): All other risks

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Version Locking**: All dependencies specified at exact versions from requirements
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time Core Web Vitals tracking with alerts
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: PWA features enhance but don't break core functionality
4. **Component Testing**: Component library structure supports comprehensive testing

### Residual Risks

1. **Future Dependency Updates**: May introduce compatibility issues (managed by monorepo structure)
2. **Browser PWA Support**: Varies by browser (mitigated by progressive enhancement)
3. **Performance Degradation**: As application grows (monitored by performance thresholds)

### Risk Owner Recommendations

- **Dev**: Monitor bundle sizes as application grows, update dependencies carefully
- **Team**: Follow established component patterns for consistency
- **Future Stories**: Consider performance impact of new features
