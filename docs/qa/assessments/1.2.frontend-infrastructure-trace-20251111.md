### Critical Gaps

None identified. All acceptance criteria have comprehensive implementation coverage.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on current infrastructure setup, recommend:

1. **Component Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for Button, StatusIndicator, and other UI components
2. **Performance Tests**: Implement Core Web Vitals threshold testing
3. **Accessibility Tests**: Add automated accessibility testing for industrial UI components
4. **PWA Tests**: Test offline functionality and service worker behavior
5. **Build Tests**: Verify bundle size limits and optimization effectiveness

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None identified
- **Medium Risk**: None identified
- **Low Risk**: All requirements have full implementation coverage

### Additional Coverage Notes
