# NFR Assessment: 1.1

Date: 2025-11-10
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Rate limiting mentioned but not implemented
- Performance: PASS - Bundle size targets and caching strategies defined
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Error handling strategy exists but implementation incomplete
- Maintainability: PASS - 80% test coverage requirement, good code structure

## Critical Issues

1. **Rate limiting not implemented** (Security)
   - Risk: Authentication endpoints vulnerable to brute force
   - Fix: Add express-rate-limit middleware to auth routes
   - Effort: ~1 hour

2. **Error handling incomplete** (Reliability)
   - Risk: Application crashes unhandled in some scenarios
   - Fix: Complete error handling middleware implementation
   - Effort: ~2 hours

## Quick Wins

- Implement rate limiting: ~1 hour
- Add comprehensive error handling: ~2 hours
- Set up performance monitoring: ~1 hour

## Evidence from Codebase

**Security Evidence:**
- JWT token management configured
- Input validation schemas planned with Zod
- CORS policy defined
- Missing: Actual rate limiting implementation

**Performance Evidence:**
- Bundle size targets: <1MB initial, <500KB subsequent
- Response time targets: <200ms API, <500ms complex queries
- Caching strategies documented
- Code splitting planned

**Reliability Evidence:**
- Error handling strategy documented
- Database connection pooling via Supabase
- Retry logic mentioned
- Incomplete: Full error handling implementation

**Maintainability Evidence:**
- 80% test coverage requirement
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Pre-commit hooks configured (husky + lint-staged)
- Monorepo structure well-organized
