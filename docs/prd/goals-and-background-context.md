# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Launch a functional maintenance work order system that tracks equipment repairs from creation to completion
- Enable 4-8 operators to view and complete assigned maintenance tasks on mobile devices
- Provide real-time visibility of work order status through a Meeting Mode Kanban board and TV display
- Track spare parts usage and alert when stock falls below minimum thresholds
- Calculate basic maintenance KPIs (MTTR, MTBF, availability) to establish baseline performance metrics

## Background Context

Small industrial maintenance teams currently manage work orders using spreadsheets, paper forms, or no system at all. This leads to lost work orders, unclear task assignments, untracked spare parts consumption, and zero visibility into maintenance performance. The GMAOapp MVP solves the immediate pain point: getting maintenance operations out of spreadsheets and into a purpose-built system that operators can access from tablets in the field.

The MVP focuses on the core workflow: supervisors create work orders and assign them to operators, operators complete work and log spare parts used, and everyone can see current status on a shared Kanban board or TV display. Advanced features like AI diagnosis, external component repairs, and complex reporting are explicitly out of scope for v1.0. The goal is to get a working system deployed in 2-4 weeks that immediately improves visibility and organization, with a clear path to add capabilities in future iterations.
